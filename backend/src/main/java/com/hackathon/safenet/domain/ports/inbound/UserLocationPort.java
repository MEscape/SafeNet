 * Inbound port for user location management.

 * with domain services related to user location tracking.</p>
 *
 * <p>It follows the hexagonal architecture pattern by defining the inbound
 * port that adapters (e.g., REST controllers, WebSocket controllers)
 * can call without depending on implementation details.</p>
